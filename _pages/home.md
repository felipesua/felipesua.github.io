### About me

Hi! I am a graduate student at MIT advised by <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/">Philippe Rigollet</a>. I obtained my B.Sc. (2016) in mathematics and electrical engineering from Universidad de los Andes. I was a data scientist at <a href="https://quantil.co/en/">Quantil</a> in 2016 and a research intern at <a href="https://www.truveta.com/">Truveta</a> in the summer of 2022. I spent several summers working at <a href="http://mathroots.mit.edu/">MathRoots</a> as a coordinator, mentor and counselor.


### Research interests

I am generally interested in the applications of Riemannian geometry (in particular information geometry) and optimal transport to problems in optimization and machine learning.
